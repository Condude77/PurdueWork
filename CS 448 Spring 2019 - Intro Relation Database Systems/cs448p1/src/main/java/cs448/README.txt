1. a. The fastest load operation was Main Memory.
   b. I think main memory was faster because it loads the data into memory where as MapDB needs to save it into a file.
   c. Overall the fastest is File Select, however Main Memory is the fastest if we just look at its query time.
   d. I think it is the fastest because it doesnt have to load the data at all, it can just iterate through the file in order to find the object.
   e. The benefits of an embedded database is that once it is loaded it can find objects faster than in memory.
