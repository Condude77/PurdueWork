I would have liked to have more practive with the Union function of spark. It is an important function because you are able to take two data sets and join them together to make one set. I would have liked to learn the different uses for it and how it would be useful in a merging of two large data sets.

I think an index feature would be nice for Spark. If I was able to get the nth entry from a database I think it would be useful as a way to get an entry without the need of a key or use of filters.
